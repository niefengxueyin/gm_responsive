                         <p>Unlike traditional Collective Investment  Scheme (&lsquo;unit trust&rsquo;) investments, RMB&rsquo;s Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) and  Exchange Traded Notes (ETNs) are traded on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. In  contrast to traditional actively managed funds, they are passively managed â€”  the performance is index-linked and allocations are rules-based. The goal is to  replicate the performance of the index, rather than to strive for  outperformance.</p>
