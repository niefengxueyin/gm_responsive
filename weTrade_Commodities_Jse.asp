                         <h2>JSE commodity futures</h2>
                         <p>SAFEX now lists WTI, Gold and Platinum  futures, allowing individual and institutional investors access to the energy  and precious metals complex. Finally, you can hedge your risks, add enhanced financial  engineering to your commodity stock portfolios, combine various equity and  commodity positions, and participate in the price appreciation of South  Africa's flagship commodities.<br />
                           <br />
                           Important for the investor, settlement in  rands means that the currency risk is removed and that the contracts will  perform according to local conditions e.g. the WTI crude contract is a good  proxy for the South African Basic Fuel Price. Risk is further decreased by  removing the physical settlement requirement of the overseas contracts while  still benefitting from the same underlying commodity exposure. The SAFEX  contracts are also smaller than their overseas counterparts allowing smaller  consumers to access the market. Larger consumers can trade in bigger volumes or  go direct to market makers such as RMB for more tailored hedging solutions.<br />
                           <br />
               South African investors can now access many  of the same commodity products enjoyed by investors in other countries. </p>
