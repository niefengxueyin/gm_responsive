            <h2>Managing your research subscriptions</h2>
            <p>Did you know that you can pick and choose which research you get from us? By clicking the “update your subscription preferences” button at the top of all research emails, you can access our entire research offering and decide which reports you’d like to receive. If you’re going to be out of the office for a while, you can also change which email address your research goes to, or, by changing the reports you do receive to “no”, you can suspend delivery of our research until you’re back in the office.<br />
              <br />
