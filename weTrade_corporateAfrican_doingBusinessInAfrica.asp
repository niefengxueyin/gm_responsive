                         <p>RMB Global Markets Africa is responsible  for the Global Markets-related businesses of the FirstRand Banking Group across  Africa. We currently have two RMB offices outside of South Africa, in Namibia  and Nigeria, but a physical presence in six other African countries (Botswana,  Lesotho, Mozambique, Swaziland, Tanzania and Zambia) via First National Bank  (FNB), our commercial banking franchise.</p>
                         <p>
                           The rest of sub-Saharan Africa is covered  by a dedicated relationship team based in Sandton, Johannesburg. The in-country  treasuries focus on fixed income, currency and commodities and, while branded  FNB, they leverage off the RMB brand and expertise. RMB Global Markets Africa has a thorough knowledge of  Africa and will be able to transact on a whole range of products to meet any  requests, local or global.</p><p>
                           We provide you with a dedicated,  on-the-ground treasury client service, which aims to understand your business  in its totality before providing solutions. This is coupled with support from  the RMB Global Markets Africa head office in Johannesburg. We also have a team  of well-respected economists who compile insightful analysis on the sub-Saharan  Africa economies and markets.</p><p>
                           We also offer a broad range of banking  solutions in countries in which we don't have a physical presence through our  network of correspondent banks, as well as offering corporate advisory  solutions via our African investment banking specialists in Johannesburg.</p><p>
                           This team has an in-depth knowledge of each market, assisting you with an  understanding of business customs, regulations and country-specific risks.  In this way we're able to ensure that you receive competitive solution pricing,  as well as superior service in meeting your banking requirements. </p><p>
                         RMB Global Markets Africa can guide those of  our clients based in the UK,  India, China and the Middle East on how best to do business in Africa using  Global Markets expertise in conjunction with other RMB specialist areas such as  Project Finance, Resource Finance, Infrastructure Finance and Corporate  Finance.<br />
