                         <p>                           The Global Markets team is inspired to  raise awareness and funds for causes close to our hearts to supplement the  fundraising undertaken by RMB. We are involved in two specific initiatives, the  Mme Dimpho Hani Childcare Centre and the <a href="http://www.leapschool.org.za" target="_blank">LEAP Science and Maths School  Alexandra</a>.<br />

                         <h3>                         Mme Dimpho Hani Childcare Centre  (Doornkop)</h3>
                         <p>                       The Mme Dimpho Hani Childcare Centre was  started by Nthabiseng Hlongwane as a place of safety where preschool children  could be fed and cared for during the day. The centre now cares for 130  children from the ages of six months to six years with four teachers to look  after the different age groups.<br />
                         <br />
                         A vegetable garden provides fresh  vegetables and a lunch-time feeding scheme cares for older siblings and the  abandoned aged. The centre relies solely on donations for any improvements to  the premises.<br />
                         <br />
                         Global Markets held a very successful  internal golf day to raise funds for the centre. We raised enough funds to  replace an old, pre-fab classroom. The new sturdy brick classroom was built  over the December holiday and the childcare centre used local suppliers and  contractors to complete the project.<br />

                         <p>                         RMB Global Market&rsquo;s involvement in the LEAP  Science and Maths schools is inspired by their vision to focus on maths and  science education in previously disadvantaged communities. They aim to  substantially increase the number of students who achieve Bachelor  Qualification Senior Certificate passes in maths and science so that they can  have access to a full range of tertiary education opportunities.
                           <br />
                           <br />
                         Global Markets also ensures that the LEAP  kids always have a place in the &ldquo;Tracker Men in the Making&rdquo; and &ldquo;Cell C Bring a  Girl Child to Work&rdquo; initiatives where RMB hosts the pupils for a day.<br />
                         <br />
