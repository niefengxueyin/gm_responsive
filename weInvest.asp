                         RMB provides a niche investment offering  comprising the below.</p>
                         <p><strong>A passive offering (index investing)</strong></p>
                         <p>
RMB  provides a diverse range of passive investment solutions to meet investor  needs. Passive investing is a style of investment management where a product&rsquo;s  performance mirrors a market index. While active investment management involves  a fund manager attempting to beat the market with various investing strategies,  passive investing is a very cost-efficient way to gain market exposure. Passive  investments can either form the core of a portfolio or provide a specialised  component that tracks a specific index.</p>
<p><strong>Alternative assets (out-of-the-ordinary assets)</strong></p>
<p>Our  solutions sometimes include assets that don&rsquo;t fall into one of the three  traditional asset classes (equities, bonds or cash). These include exposure to  commodities (for example maize, oil, platinum and gold), hedge funds, credit,  private equity and renewable energy infrastructure. The key to these  investments is their low correlation to traditional asset class returns. By  combining traditional with alternative assets, you can receive better risk  adjusted returns over time. An update to the prudential investment regulations  for retirement funds in 2011 (Regulation 28 of the Pension Funds Act)also  allows for more investment in alternative asset classes.</p><p>
<strong>Capital protection methodologies (protecting downside risk)</strong></p><p>Various methodologies are applied to many of our investments to manage  risk and protect your capital under adverse market conditions. This reduction  in large sustained losses over time contributes to your peace of mind,  portfolio stability, and the positive compounding of your capital. These  capital protection mechanisms can either be overlaid into or incorporated  within a solution — and liquidity is available against these guaranteed  products at short notice.
