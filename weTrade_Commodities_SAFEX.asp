                         <p>SAFEX now lists WTI, Gold and Platinum  futures, allowing individual and institutional investors access to the energy  and precious metals complex. Finally, you can hedge your risks, add enhanced  financial engineering to your commodity stock portfolios, combine various  equity and commodity positions, and participate in the price appreciation of  South Africa's flagship commodities.</p><p>
                           Important for the investor, settlement in  rand means that the currency risk is removed and that the contracts will  perform according to local conditions e.g. the WTI crude contract is a good  proxy for the South African Basic Fuel Price. Risk is further decreased by  removing the physical settlement requirement of the overseas contracts while  still benefitting from the same underlying commodity exposure. The SAFEX  contracts are also smaller than their overseas counterparts allowing smaller  consumers to access the market. Larger consumers can trade in bigger volumes or  go direct to market makers such as RMB for more tailored hedging solutions.</p><p>
                           South African investors can now access many  of the same commodity products enjoyed by investors in other countries.<br />

                         <h3>                         WTI</h3>
                         <p>
                           The CME group extended its licence to the  JSE to quote NYMEX WTI physically settled crude on 24 August 2009. SAFEX now  lists a WTI ZAR priced and settled contract, which is one-tenth the size of the  main NYMEX WTI contract. WTI futures (Feb, Jun, Aug and Dec) are listed on  SAFEX and include the corresponding ZAR forward points, which translate into a  ZAR/barrel price.</p><p>
                         WTI (West Texas Intermediate) crude is the  most actively traded energy complex commodity in the world. Brent (or more  correctly, BFO) is a North Sea crude whereas WTI is from the Gulf of Mexico.  WTI remains the main pricing benchmark for most other crudes.<br />

                         <h3>                           Gold</h3>
                         <p>                           The CME group extended its licence to the  JSE to quote COMEX physically settled gold on 24 August 2009. SAFEX now lists a  financially-settled ZAR priced gold contract.</p><p>
                           Gold futures (Jan. Apr, Jul and Oct) are  listed on SAFEX and include the corresponding ZAR forward points, which translate  into a ZAR/ounce price. Gold is seen as an inflation hedge and safe-haven  investment in volatile times. Gold delivery is made to COMEX-approved  warehouses around the world but this typically involves a location price  differential.</p><p>
                           Gold is traded in the interbank market as a  currency pair (XAU/USD) and exhibits a close correlation with interest rate  differentials and central bank gold lease rates.<br />

                         <h3>                           Platinum</h3>
                         <p>                           The CME group extended its licence to the  JSE to quote COMEX physically settled platinum on 24 August 2009. SAFEX now  lists a financially-settled ZAR priced platinum contract. Platinum futures  (Jan, Apr, Jul and Oct) are listed on SAFEX, including the corresponding ZAR  forward points, which translate into a ZAR/ounce price.</p><p>
                           Although platinum is also seen as an  inflation hedge and safe-haven investment, it is more of an industrial metal  than gold. Platinum delivery is made to COMEX-approved warehouses around the  world. As 80% of the world's platinum production is sourced in South Africa,  the contract will give you direct access to a major source of South Africa's  GDP.<br />

                           <p>The number of forward points on a given  exchange rate will be determined by the prevailing interest rate in each market  and the time between the spot and forward rates.<br />
