                         <h3>Quanto  futures</h3>
                         <p>The Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) and RMB, as the initial  market maker, have brought quanto futures to the South African market.</p><p>
A quanto future is a  rand-denominated commodity investment product which delivers the same payoff as  a pure dollar-denominated commodity investment while protecting investors from  USD/ZAR exchange rate fluctuations.</p><p>
South African investors don&rsquo;t always derive the full benefit  of commodity price movements due to a combination of the exchange rate and the  country&rsquo;s exchange control regulations, which govern the provision of  investments in foreign assets and require commodity investments to be listed  and settled in rand.</p><p>
As an example of how the product works, if the price of  brent crude increases by 20% in US dollar terms, the value of the investor&rsquo;s  rand product (via quanto futures) will also increase by 20%. The exchange rate  movement plays no part in determining return. </p><p>
Initially, Brent crude, gold and copper will be  referenced as part of the JSE&rsquo;s existing agreement with the CME Group.<br />

<h3>JSE  commodity futures</h3>
<p>SAFEX now lists WTI, Gold and Platinum futures, allowing  individual and institutional investors access to the energy and precious metals  complex. Finally, you can hedge your risks, add enhanced financial engineering  to your commodity stock portfolios, combine various equity and commodity  positions, and participate in the price appreciation of South Africa's flagship  commodities.</p><p>
Important for the investor, settlement in rands means that  the currency risk is removed and that the contracts will perform according to  local conditions e.g. the WTI crude contract is a good proxy for the South  African Basic Fuel Price. Risk is further decreased by removing the physical  settlement requirement of the overseas contracts while still benefitting from  the same underlying commodity exposure. The SAFEX contracts are also smaller  than their overseas counterparts allowing smaller consumers to access the  market. Larger consumers can trade in bigger volumes or go direct to market  makers such as RMB for more tailored hedging solutions.</p><p>
South African investors can now access many of  the same commodity products enjoyed by investors in other countries.<br />
