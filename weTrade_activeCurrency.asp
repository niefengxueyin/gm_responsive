                         <h2>Active Currency Management</h2>
                         <p>Until recently, it was difficult for South  Africans to enter into foreign currency hedging contracts without proof of  foreign exchange commitments. Documentary evidence had to be presented to a  bank when (or within 14 days of) establishing a currency contract. Under  previous exchange control rules, currency contracts could not be changed or  cancelled unless the underlying foreign currency obligation changed or fell  away.<br />
                           <br />
                           RMB first approached the Reserve Bank in  2005 with a request to permit a more effective method of currency management â€“  actively managed currency hedging on an over-the-counter basis.<br />
                           <br />
                           The Reserve Bank has granted permission for  banks to provide you with actively managed currency hedging facilities, in line  with international best practice. With immediate effect, you may now  restructure existing economically inefficient hedges and may hedge new types of  currency risks including balance sheet hedging/translation risk; pre-hedging of  possible future commitments; and foreign investment risk.<br />
