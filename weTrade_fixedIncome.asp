                         <p>                         RMB Global Markets pioneered the  development of the local inflation market by advising and arranging the first  inflation-linked debt placement in the South African market in 1994. We are the  premier inflation-linked debt house in South Africa and dominate primary and  secondary market trading in inflation-linked bonds and swaps. We also lead the  repo market where we are involved in almost all reported trades.</p><p>
                           RMB Global Markets has been first to market  on all new products to the local market and launched inflation futures in 2006,  which allow investors to go long or short the official inflation-linked bond  index (IGOVI). </p>

                           On the equity side, the RMB Inflation-X ETF  won the Morningstar Award for Best Diversified Bond Fund in 2013.<br />
