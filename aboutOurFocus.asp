                         <p>We believe that the key to a successful  business relationship is understanding  your organisation and its needs — then we apply our strong product ability  to building a solution that truly meets your requirements.<br />
                           <br />
                           Our comprehensive suite of corporate  financial solutions range from transactional banking and cash management to  cross-border trade, multi-asset investments, working capital finance and risk  management solutions.<br />
                           <br />
                         Our innovative thinking and robust systems  enable us to partner with our institutional, corporate, wealth, retail and  public sector clients to create long-term, reliable and sustainable execution,  asset servicing, prime broking and clearing solutions. We also have a proven  track record in providing alternative and enhanced fund solutions in various  asset classes in South Africa, Africa, the UK, China and India.<br />
                         <br />
                         </p>
                         <h3>Ever-expanding</h3>
                         <p>We currently have two branches outside of  South Africa, one in the United Kingdom and the other in India, two RMB offices  outside of South Africa, in Namibia and Nigeria, but a physical presence in six  other African countries (Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique, Swaziland, Tanzania and  Zambia) via First National Bank (FNB), our commercial banking franchise as well  as representative offices in Angola, China, Dubai, Ghana and Kenya. The rest of  sub-Saharan Africa is covered by a dedicated relationship team based in  Johannesburg. The in-country treasuries focus on fixed income, currency, and  commodities and, while branded FNB, they leverage off the RMB brand and  expertise. Our London branch offers access to the international investor base.<br />
