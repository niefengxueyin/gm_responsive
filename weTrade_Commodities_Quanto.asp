                         <h2>Quanto futures</h2>
                         <p>The Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) and  RMB, as the initial market maker, have brought quanto futures to the South  African market.<br />
                           <br />
                           A quanto future is a  rand-denominated commodity investment product which delivers the same payoff as  a pure dollar-denominated commodity investment while protecting investors from  USD/ZAR exchange rate fluctuations.<br />
                           South African investors don&rsquo;t always derive  the full benefit of commodity price movements due to a combination of the  exchange rate and the country&rsquo;s exchange control regulations, which govern the  provision of investments in foreign assets and require commodity investments to  be listed and settled in rand.<br />
                           <br />
                           As an example of how the product works, if  the price of brent crude increases by 20% in US dollar terms, the value of the  investor&rsquo;s rand product (via quanto futures) will also increase by 20%. The  exchange rate movement plays no part in determining return. <br />
                           <br />
                           Initially, Brent crude, gold and copper  will be referenced as part of the JSE&rsquo;s existing agreement with the CME Group.<br />
