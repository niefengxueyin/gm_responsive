                         <p>To complement our in-country treasuries in eight African  countries outside of South Africa, RMB offers African and G20 currency dealing  from our Johannesburg dealing room. </p><p>Chinese companies can now conduct cross-border  renminbi (CNY) transactions with international counterparties, which creates  opportunities in corporate hedging and cash management for businesses across  Africa. Chinese suppliers are gradually starting to invoice in local currency  to mitigate losses that arise from repatriating at a lower US dollar rate.  Large importers from China can also now use their leverage to negotiate better  pricing based on renminbi invoicing.<br />

                         <h3>Active  Currency Management</h3>
                         <p>Until recently, it was difficult for South Africans to enter  into foreign currency hedging contracts without proof of foreign exchange  commitments. Documentary evidence had to be presented to a bank when (or within  14 days of) establishing a currency contract. Under previous exchange control  rules, currency contracts could not be changed or cancelled unless the  underlying foreign currency obligation changed or fell away.</p><p>
RMB first approached the Reserve Bank in 2005 with a request  to permit a more effective method of currency management â€“ actively managed  currency hedging on an over-the-counter basis.</p><p>
The Reserve Bank has granted permission for banks to provide  you with actively managed currency hedging facilities, in line with  international best practice. With immediate effect, you may now restructure  existing economically inefficient hedges and may hedge new types of currency  risks including balance sheet hedging/translation risk; pre-hedging of possible  future commitments; and foreign investment risk.</p><p>
